I am located in the Piedmont Triad are, NC (Zone 7-8) and also for some of my readers zones- 9 and 10.

Here are my top 10 most underused plants that have to meet a strict criteria:</strong>

They must to grow well in our area, with a minimum of care (OK- you still have to water them- but little else.) They must have several attractive characteristics (i.e Beautiful bark AND leaves, OR great flowers AND branching pattern,etc.) they must not be on every street corner- so we can create a unique look when they are used. Take a look at these selections by zone:
<h2><strong>UNDERUSED PLANTS FOR ZONE 7-8</strong></h2>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Chionanthus Virginicus - (Fringetree).</strong> This small to medium tree has beautiful blooms in the spring. Soft green leaves and fringe like blooms give the tree its name. grows to 20-25 ‘ tall at maturity.</li>

 	<li><strong>Edgeworthia chrusanthua - (Paperbush.)</strong> This blooms when very little else is in EARLY spring. Great fragrance to the blooms- a nice touch to the late/winter/early spring landscape. Use as a small specimen tree or focal point- grows 6-10’ tall and wide.</li>

 	<li><strong>Cytstisus scoparius - (Scotch Broom.) </strong>Very attractive branching pattern, leaves and blooms. Great blooms in the early spring- deer resistant too! Will grow to 3’ tall and wide.</li>

 	<li><strong>Illisium floridatum - (Anise.)</strong> You will notice some crossover with this plant, also doing well in zones 9-10. Again, I Love the red blooms and evergreen foliage. Use as a large hedge, screen or accent plant.</li>

 	<li><strong>Abelia ‘Kaleidoscope’</strong>– Gorgeous full sun evergreen. Variegated green and yellow foliage on red stems. White flowers in spring and will grow to a mature height of 2.5’- 3’ tall and wide.</li>

 	<li><strong>Corylus contorta - ( Harry Lauder’s Walking Stick.)</strong> “Stick’ this in your yard (no pun intended) for a great conversation piece. I also see it quite often in a  container- but it would eventually have to be moved to allow the plant to fill out.</li>

 	<li><strong>Cedrus atlantica - (Blue Atlas Cedar.)</strong> This large evergreen will make a statement in any garden. I love the steel blue foliage and striking branching pattern. Great for a unique look in the winter landscape. Ultimately grows to 15-20’ tall and 6-10 wide after 10 years.</li>

 	<li><strong>Sarcococca ruscifolia - (Sweetbox.)</strong> Small evergreen shrub- 2.5’ ht at maturity. The flowers are fragrant and it is a deer resistant resistant plant.</li>

 	<li><strong>Hellebore orientalis - (Coral Bells.)</strong> Blooms in the winter about when the Paperbush is blooming. The star shaped evergreen foliage is beautiful year round and stands about 2’ tall in height. The pink/white blooms emerge in winter and persist until after the last frost.</li>

It is a moderate grower- growing 10- 15 feet tall at maturity. The lovely hue of the gray green foliage shows well in contrast to the beautiful white flowers in early summer. Tasty guava-like fruit becomes ripe in late fall. Landscape uses can be specimen tree, or can be pruned to a hedge.</li>
